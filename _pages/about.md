I'm Ethan, a 4th year at UCLA majoring in Biophysics and minoring in Data Science Engineering. My current academic interests include neurophysics, medical technologies, machine learning, and mathematics.

This Summer, I'll be continuing my research in neurophysics as part of the [Elegant Mind Collaboration](https://www.elegantmind.org/) in UCLA. Currently I'm invovled in the Microscopy Group working on the 3D vessel imaging project with the goal of quantitatively measuring internal stresses of blood vessels using stereo images for 3D reconstruction. I'm also currently the Technical Vice President  at [CruX UCLA](https://www.cruxucla.com/), or our school's largest student-led neurotech organization. 

On the side, I enjoy playing [jazz piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHOn8u-c2wk&list=PLjXOgoBES9TnGGyhS1eDH3uup_jAU-2GA), jogging or hiking with friends/family, browsing random Wikipedia articles, speedcubing, and picking up new skills.

This site serves mostly as a hub to other links such as my email, Github, LinkedIn, Youtube channel, and personal projects. Happy exploring!
