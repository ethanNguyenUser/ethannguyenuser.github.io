Check out my public notes on [ethann.netlify.app](https://ethann.netlify.app)!

Near the end of my sophomore year in college, I came to realize that it is impossible to retain every detail learned from my classes. Since then, I've gotten into the habit of taking linked, semantic notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a nifty note-taking software. With linked notes, I find I that if I can only recall a certain subset of a subject I want to relearn, I can simply go through the connected web of notes to refresh my understanding. I'm using Obsidian as my personal knowledge management system (KMS) for now because its use of markdown files ensures longevity, its many plugins such as [LaTeX Suite](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite) streamlines mathematical typesetting, and its linking capabilities encourages modularization of notes for better organization.
